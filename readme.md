# HOW IT WORKS

#### Method haffman() in Haffman class requires two parameters:
    - path to directory which has destination files 
    - boolean flag whether we want to compress or to decompress file(-s)

#### Compression:
    -directory must contain at least one file to compress. The extension must be only txt.
    -file names shouldn't end with '_compressed' or '_dictionary'

#### Decompression:
    -directory must contain at least two file to decompress file. The extension must be only txt.
    -File which ends with _comressed is source file.
    -File which ends with _dictionary id dictionary for appropriate file

Every mistake in file names will lead to termination of coding/encoding.
